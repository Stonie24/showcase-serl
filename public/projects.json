      "descriptionLong": "Home Assistant is a home automation platform that brings all your smart devices together, regardless of brand, and lets you control them from one interface. Itâ€™s fast, secure, and runs locally, meaning your data stays in your home. You can create automations to make your devices work together, like turning off lights when you leave or adjusting the thermostat when a window opens. Plus, it's open-source, so the community keeps adding new features and device support over time. Essentially, it gives you full control over your smart home without relying on the cloud.",
